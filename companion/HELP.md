## Framework Macropad

This is a simple module to turn the [Framework 16 RGB Macropad](https://frame.work/gb/en/products/16-rgb-macropad) into a simple Companion surface.

This requires some custom firmware, which is available from https://github.com/Julusian/framework_qmk_firmware. This firmware replaces the default behaviour with a simple HID device that Companion can take control of.

Once setup, the macropad will become a 4 column, 6 row surface, with the RGB backlight of each key set to match the background colour of each button.
